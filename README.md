<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Built with Vite, Vue.js, and TailwindCSS. Previously, in (https://devchallenges.io/solutions/geeqUQRhbSDcPw7NVzjo) I couldn't change the title dynamically. On this page, I didn't set the title indirectly on the parent page (index.html) as before. I changed the title with 'document.title'. In this case, it might be a good thing to do, but I don't know what if there really are a lot of pages, I'll look for it later.

I have a little difficulty in placing the text that is rotated correctly because each text has a different width, I managed to fix it by inserting an inline style into the parent text to adjust the width.
